Great!
This is correct, but consider.. 

if  Month >= 1 and month <= 3:   

This potentially is 4 separate tests:   x>1?  x==1?  x<3?  x==3?
but using this instead:

if Month < 4:
elif Month < 7:
elif Month <10:
else: 

 is a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 3 tests for all of the same results,
 instead of the potentially 16 tests that you used. 

This is a small example, but imagine if you were processing thousands of data requests. 
The user would definitely get frustrated by the slow down.
