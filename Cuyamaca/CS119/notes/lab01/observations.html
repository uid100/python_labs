<h2>Lab01 <em>Observations</em></h2>
<p>
    We don't meet in class each week. I don't get the opportunity to walk 
    through an example and look up and see people smiling back at me, or
    nodding agreement, or falling asleep, or looking like a <em>deer-in-the-headlights</em>, 
    which might tell me that someone is so confused they don't know where they
    got off-track and may or may not know what to ask.
</p>
<p>
    In the classroom, I can catch that right away, back up, try again, and find
    right where things started to go sideways. Sometimes I just have to guess.
</p>
<h3>Feedback</h3> General comments
<ul>
<li>
    Again, because we don't meet every week, my primary means of letting you know 
    how you're doing is to provide feedback on your assignments. Usually this means 
    about 30 minutes on average per assignment. This semester, this is a big class
    and I just won't have time to provide as much detail as I wish I could.
</li>
<li>
    I haven't gotten through all of the submissions, there are a lot of you. But 
    there are some things that I noticed in Lab #1 that I thought I'd share with 
    everyone. If this is just a review for you, great! This way, I hope that everyone
    gets the benefit of some of the feedback that I might have written to only 
    a few individuals. If it's still confusing, please let me know. 
</li>
<li>
    Remember, Wednesday afternoons, I'm online. Bring your questions. If you send email 
    on Friday night, there's a chance that I won't be able to respond until Monday, 
    and if there are a lot of questions, it might take longer for me to get you 
    an answer.
</li>
<li>
    <strong>Read the instructions</strong>. I know, you've heard it before.
    Most of the time, students miss out on points because they didn't read to the 
    end of the lab, or skipped a step. We've tried to make the lab instructions 
    pretty clear and complete. I know that mistakes happen (to us too), you 
    can help us find them by paying attention to detail.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>File names</h3>
    <p>The first part of the lab was set up your folder structure.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Many systems traditionally don't allow using spaces in file (and folder)
            names. This is a good practice for all of your files, but especially
            when writing code. <strong>Lab01</strong> is not the same as <strong>Lab 01</strong>
            or <strong>Lab assignment 1</strong>. When you start processing multiple
            data files, using <em>spaces</em> in file names will cause you heartache. 
            Learn to avoid that now.
        </li>
        <li>
            There are 16 weeks and 12 Labs in this class. If you name your folders: Lab1, Lab2,
            Lab3, ... then your files will sort themselves as Lab1, Lab10, Lab11, Lab12, Lab2, Lab3...
            I suppose this is ok, but it might be frustrating when you're looking for a file.
        </li>
        <li>
            When you submit your file (and it is called Lab01.zip) it unzips to the same folder
            structure that I'm expecting, and it's easy for me to find, and shows that 
            you read and followed the instructions.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Next you created a new file and saved it as a text file.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The file name suggested was <strong>Lab1Pseudocode.txt</strong>, really 
            the naming isn't too critical, but this one is very clear and I know what's 
            in the file, just from the name. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Notice there are no spaces in the file name. This isn't as important since 
            it's a text file and it is only intended to be read as a reference and is not
            likely to be processed like a data file. Still, best practice is to avoid spaces.
        </li>
        <li>
            It is descriptive. If you decided to include your program design logic
            designs (that's what pseudocode is!) for all three exercises in the same file, 
            that's fine. Please include some kind of separator so that I can easily find
            what I'm looking for. If you put each in it's own file, then name the files
            something descriptive so that I know where to look. <strong>Lab1PseudocodeEx2.txt</strong>
            and <strong>Lab1PseudocodeEx3.txt</strong>, or maybe <strong>Lab1_Ex2_KmToMi_pseudocode.txt</strong>
            and <strong>Lab1_Ex2_MiToKm_pseudocode.txt</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>File Extensions</strong>. Before you go any further, be sure you have 
            your computer settings to <strong>show file extensions</strong>.
            In Windows, open the File Explorer and the View menu, this changes a little 
            from version to version, you might need to Google it. On MacOS, open
            Finder and Preferences and Advanced. Every developer should be able to see this 
            information. I do not know why the Microsoft Engineers decided (about 10 years ago) 
            that they needed to "protect" the user from seeing this.<br>
            
            Your pseudocode should have the extension ".txt." I know that a very few systems
                used the extension ".text" for a little while, and that it is recognized by most 
                systems, but the standard is ".txt" so it is highly recommended that you 
                use it.<br>
            In fact, file extensions aren't that important at all and they don't really
                change or impact the content of the file at all, but it's a convention and it 
                really is helpful in identifying the contents of a file.<br>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
        <p>Remember, this is your <strong>Program Design</strong>. This is the plan. This is
            the logical sequence, the instructions. There are different ways to do this. The 
            style used in the example is just a suggestion.
            </p>
            <ul>
        <li>
            This is written in simple language and its <em>purpose</em> is for the 
            architects and designers and engineering team to plan what needs to be
            done and in what order. It contains all of the information needed to 
            write the code for the solution.
        </li>
        <li>
            I know that you are a team of one. But in common practice, this design
            document gets reviewed and agreed upon and then handed off to the programmer.
            The programmer doesn't have to come back and ask all of the questions that 
            have already been discussed and documented in the pseudocode.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Pseudocode is not code.</strong> Do not submit a copy of your program
            code as a text file and call it <em>pseudocode</em>. In fact, often 
            the pseudocode won't even make an assumption about which programming language
            the solution will use. <strong>Please, please, please</strong> don't do this.
        </li>
        <li>
            Syntax is not important in pseudocode. You can use hash symbols (#) or double-slashes (//) 
            to indicate comments if it's helpful to clarify information that isn't part of the 
            processing, but really, it's all a comment file, so this isn't always necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <em>hash-bang</em> or <em>shebang!</em> (#!) line is a special instruction to the 
            Operating System kernel (Windows cmd or Powershell or Linux Bash or csh shell...). It 
            gives special instructions about what to do with this file. Your pseudocode is not
            meant to be "run" by the computer, only viewed by people, so it should <em>only</em> be 
            included in your program (and script) code. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Plain language.</strong> In our case, English. Your code should be written in 
            such a way that you could hand it to your roommate or grandmother and he or she should 
            be able to read it and understand it. <em>"Oh, I see. It says that you're going to ask 
            somebody to type something on their computer, and you're going to take whatever they 
            give you, do some math and then tell them the answer they're looking for. I'm so proud
            of you. Here's a quarter."</em>
            </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Python Solution</h3>
    <p>Each exercise will ask you to write and test your code for the solution. We use Python 
        in this class because it's a relatively simple language to learn and use, but it does 
        have some details that you'll need to learn along the way.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>File names</strong> again, this should be clear and tell anyone exactly what is 
            in the file. The example in exercise 1 was called "multiply.py" This is a Python file 
            (.py) that is used to multiply something. The next exercise was used to convert Kilometers
            to Miles and the suggestion was to name it "KmToMiles.py" From this name, you can see 
            that it's a Python file that will convert a value in Km to another value in Miles.
            <ul>
                <li>Can you guess what "AreaOfACircle.py" might do?</li>
                <li>What do you think "stadium_attendance_counter.py" is used for?</li>
                <li>Are you as confused as I am about the file "Attempt64.py"?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Extensions</strong>. Remember the paragraph above about enabling file extensions? That is more important here. 
            Every semester, I have students skip that step, and save files as "something_clever.py" 
            and then when they submit the file, they are surprised to see that their computer
            actually called that file "something_clever.py.py" which becomes a real problem when 
            the file contains library module code (something we'll talk about in a few weeks.)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>That "shebang!" thing.</strong> Yes, we'll talk more about it later. It need to be here. And it
            needs to be on line 1 of the program (not line 2 after a blank line). Well, actually it 
            doesn't always. If you leave the line off, IDLE will still know how to run the code,
            but if you try and run it from the command line for instance from another computer, 
            it will probably have an unexpected result. Be sure to include it. It's part of the 
            instructions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Variables and Constants</strong>. Just like file names, give your variables names 
            that have a clear meaning.
            <ul>
                <li>If I multiply two numbers, the result is called the product so: product = number1 * number2</li>
                <li>If I want to convert feet to inches: inches = feet * inches_per_foot</li>
                <li>Can you tell what this code does? area_of_a_circle = pi * radius * radius</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Comments</strong>. Sometimes a comment can be used to clarify something for the developer that 
            is not really part of the code, but it might help later when they come back and try 
            to fix something or remember why something was written the way it is. The comments at the top:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    # Lab #x, exercise #y<br>
                    # Calculate the median density of a selection of moon rocks.<br>
                    # Author: Developer2@BigSoftware.com <br>
                    # 1 Apr 2020<br>
                    # (c) 2002, Big Software Company of Toledo, OH, Inc.<br>
                    I know who wrote this, when it was written, where to go with questions (maybe), and what 
                    it was intended to do. This is a good use of comments. They're not all 
                    required. For this class, I've asked you to identify which lab, which exercise, 
                    the function of the code and your name (please don't forget this, I open a lot of files, 
                    it helps me to make sure that I'm looking at the right file). You can add more if 
                    it's helpful for you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    # variable declarations<br>
                    # constants<br>
                    # process<br>
                    # output<br>
                    These might be useful. It tells me what's supposed to be in that section. 
                    It's certainly not required. I can probably tell from looking at the code 
                    what's in that part, but maybe while I'm learning, I'll leave that in as a 
                    reminder to me what I need to work on next or more quickly find an error 
                    if my program starts to misbehave.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Too much? Can you have too many comments? Maybe. If your variables have really 
                    good names so their meaning is clear, and your operations are relatively 
                    simple, so that the purpose is obvious, then maybe extra comments are needed, 
                    but while you're learning, add as many as you find are helpful. And anything 
                    that might not be obvious to someone else looking at your code, might need 
                    more comments to explain the purpose or usage.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Testing</strong>. How much testing is <em>enough</em>?
            <ul>
                <li>
                    When you run your "multiply.py" code, maybe you entered 6 and 7 and got 42,
                and 5 and 10 and got 50, and 25 and 5 and got 125, and 1 and 7 returned 7. How many times
                do you need to test it? How many tests should you run? Testing is a really big subject.
                The answer is, it depends.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Did you test your km to miles program and find that 10 Km equals 
                (approximately) 6.21 miles? did you see that 1000 km is about 621.4 miles? What about 0.5 km?
                Did it calculate correctly, or did it give you an error because your code was looking for an
                integer? Did you run the next exercise and test that 6.21 miles is (about) 9.99 miles?</li>
                <li>
                    You can't test every possible input, but you can test enough to convince yourself that your 
                    application does what it's supposed to do.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Always test your code!</strong> A company's reputation can be easily destroyed by software that 
                    crashes or produces an incorrect result. Lives may depend on it.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
